# Aerofly Data Integration with SayIntentions ATC and Moving Map

This application allows you to connect Aerofly fs4 to SayIntentions ATC using VR or a tablet.  It also has a moving map.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Read the `instructions.pdf` file to see how to set up and install this application.

Improvements and features to this project will be documented in the changLog.txt file.

I created a part one and part two demo videos that shows it working.

This is the original script that that I used as a foundation. I modified so I could use my radio interface and connect to SayIntentions ATC and have a moving map. I wanted to give credit to the author of this script.
