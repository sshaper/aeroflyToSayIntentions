# Pull Request: Fix Emoji Display Compatibility Across Platforms

## Summary
This PR addresses emoji rendering issues that prevent airport icons from displaying properly on macOS and other operating systems.

## Problem
- Airport icons (üè¢, üöÅ) and aircraft icons (‚úàÔ∏è) were not displaying on macOS
- Users couldn't see or select airports due to missing visual indicators
- Font rendering differences between operating systems caused display issues

## Solution
